# Applied Visual Design
Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.

At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.

## HTML style tags
- `<strong>` applies `font-weight: bold;` to the text
- `<u>` applies `text-decoration: underline;` to the text
- `<em>` applies `font-style: italic;` to the text
- `<s>` applies `text-decoration: line-through;` to the text
- `<hr>` adds a horizontal line across the width of its containing element

## Colors
- `rgb()` where r - red, g - green, b - blue
- `rgba()` where r - red, g - green, b - blue and a - alpha/level of opacity
- hex codes like `#000000` (for black) or `#000` (short version for black)
